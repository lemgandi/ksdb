# Introduction #

The crudest possible application generator, written in C++ with the QT 3.3 library.
I know this project will build on kubuntu 8.10 ("Intrepid Ibex") and kubuntu 6.06 ("Dapper Drake"). It uses nothing but C++ and QT 3.3, so it should build and run on any system which supports that development environment.

# Building #

There are Makefiles in the directories "screenmaker" and "editview".  Run make in each of those directories.
