Running ksdb

This application currently consists of two programs: modelmaker and
editview. Every other binary executable is a unit test. First, build
the programs in the "editview/" and "modelmaker/" directories (see
"BUILDING.txt" for hints on how to do this).

modelmaker

Run the "modelmaker" executable from an X terminal or a desktop icon.
Paint regions on the application screen by moving the mouse while
holding down the mouse button, then specify what they are by filling
out the forms. Be sure to include at least a "Prev" and a "Next"
button on your screen.  Write a file containing your painted screen
from the File menu by selecting "Save".

editview

Run the"editview" executable from an X terminal or a desktop icon.
Fill out the database name, table name, and interface type on the form
which comes up the first time you run "editview" with that file.  You
can now fill out the widgets on the entry screen you have created. The
data from those widgets will go into the table behind the screen when
you bonk the "Prev" or "Next" buttons.
