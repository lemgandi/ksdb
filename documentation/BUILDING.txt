Building ksdb


This is a fairly straight-up QT 3.3 application. You will need a QT
3.3 development toolchain loaded on your machine. On Ubuntu, this is
in the packages libqt3-mt-dev, qt3-dev-tools, and libqt3-headers.  
If you are planning to actually develop, you will probably need the
qt3 designer ( "qt3-designer" on ubuntu). All of these are necessary
to build KDE 3 as well, of course.

To build the application in each of the source directories, find the
".pro" file and use qmake. To build the screenmaker test, for example:

cd screenmaker
qmake -o Makefile screenmaker.pro
make

Should result in a working "./screenmaker" application.

The qt3 designer uses paths from the root to name its project files,
so you will have to edit editview/editview.pro and
modelmaker/modelmaker.pro in order to get those projects to build
correctly.  You can easily change the paths there to the correct paths
with your favorite text editor by globally changing "/home/devel/ksdb"
to ".." . 

Have Fun.
